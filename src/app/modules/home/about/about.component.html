          <h3>About <span class="ora-logo-black"></span></h3>
          <h4>Discover Orastays</h4>
          <p>In 2013 two young and energetic founders of Orastays recognised how intimidating a big city can be for a traveller. High end, mid-size or economy hotels, many online vacation rentals, are helpful but can't always meet the satisfaction a traveller expects. Homestay by Orastays is a unique blend of comfort and individualized touch at an affordable price compared to the impersonal luxury offered by commercial properties at a pocket pinching fee. </p>
          <div #orasJourney hidden>
            <h4>Tracing Orastays’ Journey</h4>
            <p>Founded under the proprietorship of ‘Sinhas Home’, a specific property in Salt Lake, Kolkata, Orastays began with a paltry capital of 1,275 USD making rooms available for both single men and women who travelled to the city to meet short-term professional or educational goals. They enjoyed the distinctive touch that the Orastays location provided. By 2015 the company had made 29% profit with 3 homestay properties having 18 rooms under its banner. Now Orastays has aggregated more than 190 rooms in 22 homestay buildings and its market size is heading towards a steady growth. </p>

                Orastays recognised that international travel is crucial to 
                many urban economies around the world. People just do not travel 
                for holidays, and a large section that includes students and professionals’
                 alike travel on tight budget. </p>
              <p #ourJourney hidden>Many companies are curtailing expenses for
                  their sales and IT teams travelling to other cities. 
                  Instead of spending on high budget hotels they are choosing
                   premium properties from Orastays with comfortable travel experience 
                   for overnight or a short-term stay. Medical tourists also widely seek 
                   homestays listed on Orastays.
                Conversely house owners looking for extra revenue are happy to share their
                 spaces, while supplying   the comforts of home by meeting the standards
                  set by Orastays. This two-fold model marketplace of sharing economy
                   is building a society based on trust, relationship, respect, and 
                   a greater global culture. </p>

            <p>When we are in the midst of a sustainable awakening, Orastays standardised homestays, based on the principle of shared economy agree with the goals of sustainable development with an efficient use of existing resources.</p>
            <p>Orastays is creating social values, enhancing the society culturally, and environmentally making a valuable contribution to the community. They are cutting cost across all levels by saving on water, energy, food, and recycling but keeping up good and reasonable standards of hospitality.</p>
            <div #sustainabilityMore hidden>
              <p>Homestays are playing a key role in the discovery of new tourism destinations and promoting the local shops and businesses. The nature of consumer participation and collaborative consumption is the driving force of sustainability. </p>
              <p>On the demand side, the access to sharing economy creates new markets every day. It involves ‘high impact' capital which is its people, it places this capital to higher degrees of full deployment. Ora, based on the network of social exchanges, blurs the line between personal and purely professional. The coming home feeling from the airport is much more appealing than driving to a hotel.</p>
              <p>Job roles are also more flexible as the guests can become hosts and hosts, guests by exchanging their properties. Technology helps to create a better and a larger community of like-minded people who not only communicate to book a homestay but also reach out to build a lasting friendship.</p>
